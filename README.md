## Git vs. GitHub

Git and Gihub are tools that not only coders, but anyone who wants to keep track of a project, use to keep previous versions of a file and allow others to make their own version of a file.  
  
###Git
* Git is a tool on the command line that allows you to keep track of previous version of a file or project using snapshots.  
  
###Github
* Github is a website that allows you to upload screenshots of your file or project where you can clone your work from the website into another computer and work on it from there.

## Initial Setup

###How to Start Using Git
1. First off, you'll need to go to a command line workspace, like [Cloud9](https://c9.io), for example. You'll have to make an account to be able to work on it.
2. Next, once you make your workspace, it'll be good to make a new directory so we can use this command:
```
mkdir learning_git
```
