## Git vs. GitHub

Git and Gihub are tools that not only coders, but anyone who wants to keep track of a project, use to keep previous versions of a file and allow others to make their own version of a file.  
  
###Git
* Git is a tool on the command line that allows you to keep track of previous version of a file or project using snapshots.  
  
###Github
* Github is a website that allows you to upload screenshots of your file or project where you can clone your work from the website into another computer and work on it from there.

## Initial Setup

###How to Start Using Git
1. First off, you'll need to go to a command line workspace, like [Cloud9](https://c9.io), for example. You'll have to make an account to be able to work on it, but you can use a Github account to log onto Cloud9, so make a Github account first and log onto Cloud9 with the Github account.
2. Next, once you make your workspace, it'll be good to make a new directory, so you can use this command:
```
mkdir learning_git
```  
_mkdir_ stands for "make directory", the command line will then make a directory and name it the second word in the command, which is *learning_git* in this case.
3. So you've made the directory, but you don't want to make a repository in the root folder, you want it in the *learning_git* directory, so you'll have to move into it using _cd_:
```
cd learning_git
```  
_cd_ means "change directory". It moves you into the folder name you put after _cd_, here it'll move us into the *learning_git* directory.
4. You'll want a file to keep track of, so let's make a README file. This command will make the file:
```
touch README.txt
```  
The _touch_ command makes files, here you made a text file named _README.txt_. Text files can be edited to contain a message. To edit the text file, look at the left of your command line and you'll see a folder named "learning_git". Click on it to reveal your README text file, then click on the file to edit it on the window above the command line. After typing something, remember to save it in the "File" tab!
